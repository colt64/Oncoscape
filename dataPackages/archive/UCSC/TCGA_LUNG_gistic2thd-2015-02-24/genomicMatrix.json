"description": "The dataset is combined from TCGA lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma datasets. TCGA lung cancer (LUNG) thresholded gene-level copy number variation (CNV) estimated using the GISTIC2 method.<br><br> Copy number profile was measured experimentally using whole genome microarray at a TCGA genome characterization center. Subsequently, GISTIC2 method was applied using the TCGA FIREHOSE pipeline to produce gene-level copy number estimates. GISTIC2 further thresholded the estimated values to -2,-1,0,1,2, representing homozygous deletion, single copy deletion, diploid normal copy, low-level copy number amplification, or high-level copy number amplification. Genes are mapped onto the human genome coordinates using UCSC cgData HUGO probeMap. Reference to GISTIC2 method PMID:21527027.<br><br>",
