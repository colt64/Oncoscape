"description": "TCGA stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) somatic mutation data.  Sequencing data are generated on a IlluminaGA system. The calls are generated at Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center using the Baylor pipeline method. <br><br> Red (=1) indicates that a non-silent somatic mutation (nonsense, missense, frame-shif indels, splice site mutations, stop codon readthroughs, change of start codon, inframe indels) was identified in the protein coding region of a gene, or any mutation identified in a non-coding gene. White (=0) indicates that none of the above mutation calls were made in this gene for the specific sample.<br><br>",
